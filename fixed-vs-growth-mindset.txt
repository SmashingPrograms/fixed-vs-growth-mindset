1. When I was younger I felt a lot more fixed than I do now. I think lot of that is because the world is often presented to young people in a very fixed way, for the sake of simplification. Now, I feel like I understand that most of what we know as human beings are learned traits, and grown traits, and we grow a lot even when we don't realize it. So whenever I have certain insecurities (which is much rarer now than it used to be), I tell myself that mistakes are learning opportunities, that shortcomings can be grown past, and that I should jump at opportunities to learn as that is tantamount to succeeding in the world.

2. It is very difficult for me to stay focused and not get overwhelmed when under a lot of pressure. I have always struggled with that sort of thing throughout my years of education, and sometimes in life and general. However, over the years I have been developing coping mechanisms to deal with these sorts of things. Per the answer to the above question, I am not perfect at this per se, but I am learning more about how to maintain good mental health all the time. Specifically, the most common solution to these sorts of issues that I've found to be helpful is to relax and calm down, think of work to do in baby steps and not in the sense of a complete product to be done in one turn, and take breaks and rest whenever necessary. When taking breaks, I find it is best to rest completely and not do anything at all, take a very short nap, or do something short and fun that's unrelated to coding (something relaxing, not strenuous!).
